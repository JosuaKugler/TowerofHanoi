# TowerofHanoi
This repository is written for the purpose of better understanding the Towers of Hanoi with multiple pegs.

Therefore it contains several functions.
The bruteforce function simply tries all possibilities and finds the possibilities that are solving the problem in the minimum number of moves.

The adjustedUpsilon function computes the number of possibilities for solving the problem with the Frame-Stewart algorithm.

In addition, there is a visualize function that can visualize different types of data and create e.g. Tower of Hanoi pictures or tables with values.

Ideas for things to add:
Python scripts that create a regular movesequence (also adding variances to those scipts in order to verify adjustedUpsilon)
Creating a movesequence out of TH.history
Add ability to plot a movesequence to visualize
