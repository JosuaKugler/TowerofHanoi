# TowerofHanoi
This repository is written for the purpose of better understanding the Towers of Hanoi with multiple pegs.

Therefore it contains several functions.
The bruteforce function simply tries all possibilities and finds the possibilities that are solving the problem in the minimum number of moves.

The adjustedUpsilon function computes the number of possibilities for solving the problem with the Frame-Stewart algorithm.

In addition, there are several nice visualization functions that help to imagine the different ways of solving the Towers of Hanoi,
however, they require latex.
