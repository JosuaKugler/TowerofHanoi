1. why is there a difference between adjustedUpsilon and bruteforceadjustedUpsilon?

If there is a intermediate tower of height 2, adjustedUpsilon says there is only one possibility to move it
However, bruteforceadjustedUpsilon sees that the smaller disk can be placed either on a bigger disk or on a smaller disk, so that there is indeed a difference according to our definition.
This is also a problem in our original conjecture.
In order to fix, there has to be a parameter specifying the number of different pegs.
This is definetely not trivial, it will prove very hard to express this with a mathematical formula.

2. Why are there more possibilities if the order of heights doesn't matter?
